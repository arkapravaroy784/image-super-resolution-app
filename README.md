# 🔍 Image Super-Resolution App (EDSR)

A deep learning–based **Image Super-Resolution web application** built using **PyTorch** and **Streamlit**.  
This app enhances low-resolution images using the **EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution)** model, producing sharper and more detailed high-resolution outputs.

## 🚀 Overview

Image Super-Resolution (SR) is the process of reconstructing a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input.  
This project leverages a **deep CNN-based EDSR model** to upscale images while preserving texture, edges, and fine details.

The application provides a **simple web interface** where users can upload an image and receive an enhanced version in real time.
